			<h1>100 Biggest Data Breaches of 2017</h1>
			<p>The ID Question is the latest series from How We Get To Next. It explores the larger implications of today's identity systems, such as India's national biometric identity project Aadhaar, and issues related to identity in the digital age.</p>

			<p>In this episode specifically, we examine individual power to control identities online when the state and corporations like Facebook and Google are the ones who control the way our data is stored, and in many cases, used. What happens when these organisations - whether government or corporate - are hacked, and our data is rendered vulnerable?</p>

			<p>We're not talking about hypotheticals though - this chart will show you the real extent of this problem. Have a play around by hovering over each circle. To read more, make sure you follow How We Get To Next online, and to discuss identities in more detail, join the series Facebook group.</p>
